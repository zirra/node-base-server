# node-base-server
Node server stub. configured to run http or https

This is being thrown up here to save some time building local node servers and
publishing server for live stuff or whatever.

on a mac you have to sudo start the server as it's set to 80, or just change the port setting 
for the express app in the index.js file.

node .

or 

npm start

webroot hosts static content.
